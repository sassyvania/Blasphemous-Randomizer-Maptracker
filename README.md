# Blasphemous Randomizer Map Tracker by Sassyvania and ViviMayoi
This is no longer being supported. After working with the rando dev for months to get this pack up and running, an in-game map tracker was added to the rando, and auto tracking support was fully removed, neither of which were told to me directly. So I guess just use the in-game version and please stop submitting issues, I'm done working on this pack.

This is my first map tracker, and there's gonna be so many mistakes, which ViviMayoi has helped me a BUNCH with, but let me know if you find more! Sassyvania@gmail.com // Saskrotch#3206

First of all, I want to give a huge thank you to Demajen, whose tireless work on extremely complete Metroidvania maps, including Blasphemous, made this tracker way less of a headache than it would've been, and for sending me a higher quailty, complete, blank map to work with.

And a hefty thank you to Damocles03, not just for making the randomizer, but for supplying me with logic spreadsheets, item and location codes, just like, so much. 

And also a big smoochy thank you to br00ty and j_im for helping me with my newbie baby codey questions!

## Installation

Unzip into PopTracker's "packs" folder. That's it! On macOS, you'll find the packs folder by right clicking on poptracker.app, clicking Show Package Contents, and navigating to `Contents > MacOS > Packs`.

## Autotracking

Autotracking is now supported for Universal Auto Tracking (UAT)! The Archipelago tracking has been removed because UAT covers way more ground and still works when connected to an archipelago game.

To run with UAT: The UAT bridge is included in the Blasphemous Randomizer 1.4.2 and up. In Blasphemous, press \ to open the console, and enter "randomizer autotracker on". It should automatically connect to the tracker, and the UAT text should turn green.

## Notes

1) Quests! These SHOULD be fully working in UAT, let me know if they're not!

No way to automatically check Chalice of Inverted Verses fill status, only aquiring the chalice is checked for.

2) All prayers are autotracked, as they can be used to break holes in the ground, but only the 9 prayers that work for other checks show up in the item list. 

3) Auto tracking and location names: A lot of check names have been changed to reflect the AP location descriptions to help new players find a check that may have been hinted at. Main goal was usability, eventually all names will be changed to reflect this.

## To-Do

Change all location names to match checks in Archipelago for ease of use

Add checks depending on which goal you're going for (the tracker will get you to Escribar, would eventually like to add goals for ending B and C with items needed)
